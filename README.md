(In develoment => limited features if you need a mature modal perhaps you would be interested in the [bootstrap modal plugin](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp]))

# infobox_matrix plugin
CSS style and jquery script to show a small portfolio.

Open demo.html to visualize how it works.

# Developing

Each _infobox is linked to a _modal_popup and a html file by their IDs.

i.e. #name  => #name_popup => #name.html

The _infobox div can be placed in any part of the html file. However the _modal_popup div HAS to be declared in the root of the body. The html file should be in a folder.

# How to use it

First is to get the css and js files. You can either add the link(to the last version) placed below or download/clone/fork the repository and link locally the files.
